# Project Name: Leaderboard

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

## Requirements:

-- Phase 1:

. Use Gitflow.

. Create an npm project with webpack.

. Write plain HTML markup with minimum styling (just to make the layout), because you will implement styles in the following steps.

. Don't make API calls (you'll do it in a following lesson).

. Use ES6 modules, with import and export


-- Phase 2:
.Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.

.Implement the "Refresh" button (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON).

.Implement the form "Submit" button (sending data to the API).

.Use arrow functions instead of the function keyword.

.Use async and await JavaScript features to consume the API.

.No styling is required.



-- Phase 3:

.Now you should improve the look and feel of the application, adding the styles of your choice.

.Please keep the general layout of the wireframe, this is the only mandatory requirement.

.You can use plain CSS or any CSS framework, it's up to you.
